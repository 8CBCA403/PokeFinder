This will be a RNG Tool for all main Pokémon games generations 3-7. It currently supports parts of generation 3.

PokéFinder is a cross platform RNG tool that is coded from my knowledge of Pokémon games and inspired by parts of RNG Reporter, GameCubeRNG, PPRNG(eventually), and 3DSRNG Tool(eventually) and currently has the following features:
- Gen 3 RNG(Stationary; including Gales/Colo/Channel, Wild)
